### Planning story
Planning this project has been so fun. Building a website from the ground up and I have all creative control is so liberating to me. Yes, I am nervous because it’s a lot that I’m completely comfortable with but looking back at the 1st project I’m in a much better head space coming into this project. I plan on staying levelheaded and stress free and celebrate my small victories and conquer the major problems. Also making sure is I’m stuck for too long reaching out and asking for help, so I’m stuck on that one problem and still have 10 more waiting.
